# EatCoffee(working title)
(Very Much WIP)  

Wrapping some abstraction over [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/).   
The main goal is to simplify creating objects and rendering process.  
The second goal is to set up a playground for little 2d game dev. Nothing special  
just to make learning rust and cg more fun. (further maybe more)  
  
For now, it is just a copy of wgpu framework.

### Targets (2d):
- [ ] Setup.
- [ ] Hello World (Triangle).
- [ ] Textures.
- [ ] Complex shape.
- [ ] Move shape around.
- [ ] Multiple instances.
- [ ] Render text (using different fonts).
- [ ] ?
### Targets (3d):
- [ ] ?
